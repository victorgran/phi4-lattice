# To Do's

- [ ] For the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo:
  - [ ] For a fixed mass (-1), obtain the time step sizes for different lattice sizes that give a target acceptance.
  - [ ] For two given (large) lattice sizes, obtain the time step sizes for different values of the squared mass that give a target acceptance.
  - [ ] For all of the above parameters, thermalize the field configurations and record the last thermalized states to start generating samples.
  - [ ] Generate a _large_ number of samples.
- [ ] For the uniform proposal:
  - [ ] For a fixed mass (-1), obtain the half-widths for different lattice sizes that give a target acceptance.
  - [ ] For two given (large) lattice sizes, obtain the half-widths for different values of the squared mass that give a target acceptance.
  - [ ] For all of the above parameters, thermalize the field configurations and record the last thermalized states to start generating samples.
  - [ ] Generate a _large_ number of samples.
